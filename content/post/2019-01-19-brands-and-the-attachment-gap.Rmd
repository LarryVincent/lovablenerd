```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gt)

df <- read_csv("../data/attachment/20180605-BDI.csv")
```

Following are the actual attachment scores from the study, based on stated connection to the brand.

```{r attachment_overview, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
 df %>% 
  select(contains("Connect")) %>% 
  gather(brand, score) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(score)) %>% 
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(score == 1)) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/1351) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  gt()
```
